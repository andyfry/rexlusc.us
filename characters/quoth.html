                <h1>Quoth the Raven</h1>
                <h2>Played By: Andy Fry</h2>
                <h2>Race: Kenku</h2>
                <h2>Class: Monk</h2>
                <p>A kenku monk. Blah Balh Balh.My name can't be pronounced in common. Nor can it be replicated in any script known to the many peoples on Exandria. The Platinum Claw monks called me Quoth the Raven, so by that name I am known.</p>
                <p>Seeing as my Kenku Curse keeps me from sharing my story, even to my closest of friends, I have decided to undertake the recording of my life in the pages of this tome. Maybe someday this will be used to educate the masses here in Wildmount that we Kenku are not the monsters we appear to be.</p>
                <p>Born among the Kenku of the Lotusden Greenwoods and trained by the Draconbloods of the Platinum Claw Monestary in the south of the Penumbra Range, my life has been one of Duality. Two names. Two societies. Two Gods.</p>
