Today I learned that when you multi-class into fighter, you do not gain proficiency in heavy armor. I had assumed that since fighters get proficency with heavy armor, that multi-classing into a fighter would give you the same proficiency.

On page 164 of the Player's Handbook or in the multi-classing section of [DndBeyond.com](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/customization-options#Multiclassing), you can see that fighters only gain proficency in light and  medium armor as well as martial weapons.

Because of this, if you are planning on dipping into fighter for a fighting style or action surge and you plan on wearing heavy armor you are better off starting as a fighter and then switching to your main class. If you don't you will need to pick up a feat to give you heavy armour proficiency.
